# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

We have completed the WebSocket Event Subscription implementation, which allows for real-time monitoring of browser events. This feature enables clients to:

1. Connect to the MCP Browser server via WebSockets
2. Subscribe to specific types of browser events (PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK)
3. Receive real-time notifications when these events occur
4. Filter events based on URL patterns or page IDs

The next phase focuses on:

1. **Resource Management Improvements**: Implement browser resource pooling and memory optimization.
2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Further improve API documentation with examples.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthen security with network isolation and rate limiting.

## Latest Changes

- Added WebSocket event subscription models and event type definitions
- Implemented global event subscription management and broadcasting
- Created a WebSocket endpoint for browser events at `/ws/browser/events`
- Added API endpoints for subscription management (subscribe, unsubscribe, list)
- Added event filtering functionality by URL pattern and page ID
- Created test scripts for WebSocket server and client functionality
- Documented the WebSocket event feature in WEBSOCKET_EVENTS.md
- Fixed WebSocket event subscription to handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Added fallback mechanism for colorama to ensure the test script works without color output
- Added explicit WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/browser/events` to match client expectations
- Updated port configuration in test scripts to work with the latest server setup
- Modified the main server to properly handle WebSocket connections for browser events
- Implemented proper error handling for colorama import in test_event_subscription.py
- Ensured test scripts work seamlessly with or without optional dependencies

   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Request authorization

7. **Improve Developer Experience**:
   - Enhance API documentation with usage examples
   - Create CLI tool for common operations
   - Implement example scripts for common use cases

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design**: The RESTful API approach with WebSocket support is working well. Continuing with this pattern for remaining endpoints.

2. **Page Lifecycle Management**: Currently creating and destroying pages for each request. Considering implementing a page pool for better performance, especially under high load.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've established a consistent pattern using try-except blocks with structured error responses. Need to formalize this into a reusable utility.

4. **Testing Approach**: The current test script works well for basic API validation. Need to decide on a more comprehensive testing framework (pytest, etc.) for more complex tests.

5. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

7. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

8. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

9. **Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method**: Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method.

10. **Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling**: Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling.

11. **Browser Context Management**: Implementing browser context management so pages can be properly accessed and handled without synchronization issues.

12. **We're using separate WebSocket endpoints for different features**:
    - `/ws` for general communication
    - `/ws/browser/events` for event subscriptions
    
13. **Event subscriptions are managed per client connection with unique IDs**:
    - We've implemented a broadcasting mechanism that filters events based on subscription criteria
    
14. **We've decided to use JSON for all WebSocket communication for consistency and ease of debugging**:

15. **Using graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies**: Implemented try-except patterns for optional dependencies like colorama to ensure core functionality works regardless of environment setup.

16. **Aligning WebSocket URLs and port configurations**: Standardized WebSocket endpoint paths and port configurations across Docker, test scripts, and server code to ensure seamless communication.

## Open Questions

1. **Should we implement a separate authentication mechanism for WebSocket connections**:
   
2. **How should we handle reconnection logic for clients that disconnect temporarily**:
   
3. **What's the optimal approach for scaling the event broadcasting system for many simultaneous connections**:
   
4. **Should we implement event batching for high-frequency events to avoid overwhelming clients**:

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper resource management for browser instances to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

3. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.
