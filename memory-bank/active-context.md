3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Further improve API documentation with examples.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthen security with network isolation and rate limiting.

## Development Summary (March 23, 2025)

Today we accomplished:

1. **Completed MCP Protocol Extensions**:
   - Implemented Browser Navigation tools:
     - `/api/browser/navigate` - Navigate to URLs with configurable wait options
     - `/api/browser/back`, `/api/browser/forward` - History navigation
     - `/api/browser/refresh` - Page refresh
     - `/api/browser/get_url`, `/api/browser/get_title` - Page information
   - Implemented DOM Manipulation tools:
     - `/api/browser/click` - Element clicking with various options
     - `/api/browser/type` - Text input
     - `/api/browser/select` - Dropdown selection
     - `/api/browser/fill_form` - Form field filling
     - `/api/browser/check_visibility` - Element visibility checking
     - `/api/browser/wait_for_selector` - Element waiting
   - Implemented Visual Analysis tools:
     - `/api/browser/screenshot` - Element and page screenshots
     - `/api/browser/extract_text` - Text extraction
     - `/api/browser/evaluate` - JavaScript evaluation

2. **Created Test Script**:
   - Implemented comprehensive test script `test_mcp_tools.sh` that verifies all MCP Protocol Extensions
   - Fixed issues with asynchronous browser context management
   - Ensured proper parameter handling in API calls

3. **Fixed Implementation Issues**:
   - Fixed bug with browser_context.pages property handling
   - Implemented proper error handling for all endpoints
   - Fixed screenshot functionality for elements vs pages
   - Made page management more robust

4. **Previously Accomplished**:
   - Completed Accessibility Testing API
   - Completed Responsive Design Testing API
   - Enhanced Testing Framework
   - Improved Documentation
   - Enhanced Development Tools

We've successfully implemented all the planned frontend analysis APIs and MCP Protocol Extensions, making the MCP Browser a comprehensive tool for AI agents to test, analyze, and interact with web pages across different dimensions (visual, DOM structure, CSS, accessibility, responsive design, and direct browser interaction).

## Next Steps

1. **Implement WebSocket Event Subscriptions**: Begin implementation of WebSocket-based event subscriptions for real-time browser event monitoring:
   - Page load events
   - DOM mutation events
   - Console log monitoring
   - Network request tracking

2. **Enhance Resource Management**: Improve browser resource management with:
   - Page pooling for better performance
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Memory usage monitoring

3. **Implement Verification Agent**:
   - Static analysis integration
   - Unit test automation
   - Security checks implementation

4. **Enhance Security**: Strengthen security with:
   - Network isolation
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Request authorization

5. **Improve Developer Experience**:
   - Enhance API documentation with usage examples
   - Create CLI tool for common operations
   - Implement example scripts for common use cases

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design**: The RESTful API approach with WebSocket support is working well. Continuing with this pattern for remaining endpoints.

2. **Page Lifecycle Management**: Currently creating and destroying pages for each request. Considering implementing a page pool for better performance, especially under high load.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've established a consistent pattern using try-except blocks with structured error responses. Need to formalize this into a reusable utility.

4. **Testing Approach**: The current test script works well for basic API validation. Need to decide on a more comprehensive testing framework (pytest, etc.) for more complex tests.

5. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

7. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

8. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

9. **Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method**: Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method.

10. **Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling**: Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling.

11. **Browser Context Management**: Implementing browser context management so pages can be properly accessed and handled without synchronization issues.

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper resource management for browser instances to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

3. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.
