# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

We have successfully completed the implementation of all core frontend analysis APIs:

1. **Screenshot Capture API** (✅ COMPLETED)
2. **DOM Extraction API** (✅ COMPLETED)
3. **CSS Analysis API** (✅ COMPLETED)
4. **Accessibility Testing API** (✅ COMPLETED)
5. **Responsive Design Testing API** (✅ COMPLETED)

The next phase focuses on:

1. **MCP Protocol Extensions**: Implement the MCP protocol extensions for browser interaction.
2. **Resource Management Improvements**: Implement browser resource pooling and memory optimization.
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Further improve API documentation with examples.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthen security with network isolation and rate limiting.

## Development Summary (March 23, 2025)

Today we accomplished:

1. **Completed Accessibility Testing API**:
   - Implemented the `/api/accessibility/test` endpoint with axe-core integration
   - Added support for multiple accessibility standards (WCAG, Section 508)
   - Created detailed violation reporting with HTML context for better debugging

2. **Completed Responsive Design Testing API**:
   - Implemented the `/api/responsive/test` endpoint with multi-viewport testing
   - Added element comparison across viewports to detect responsive issues
   - Created detailed metrics on media queries, touch targets, and layout issues
   - Implemented screenshot capture at each viewport size for visual comparison

3. **Enhanced Testing Framework**:
   - Updated test scripts to verify all API endpoints
   - Created organized output directory structure for test artifacts
   - Improved error handling and reporting

4. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api.md`
   - Added usage examples in `docs/examples/`
   - Updated Memory Bank with implementation details and learned solutions
   - Created CHANGELOG.md to track project progress

5. **Development Tools**:
   - Added GitHub PR template for better contribution workflow
   - Created running script with proper error handling and help information

We've successfully implemented all the planned frontend analysis APIs, making the MCP Browser a comprehensive tool for AI agents to test and analyze web pages across different dimensions (visual, DOM structure, CSS, accessibility, responsive design).

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Frontend Analysis APIs**: Implement the remaining frontend analysis endpoints:
   - Accessibility Testing API ✅ COMPLETED
   - Responsive Design Testing API ✅ COMPLETED

2. **Implement MCP Protocol Extensions**: Begin implementation of the MCP protocol extensions for browser interaction, starting with:
   - Browser navigation tools
   - DOM manipulation tools
   - Visual analysis tools

3. **Enhance Testing Framework**: Expand the testing framework with:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests with real browser instances
   - Performance and security tests

4. **Implement Resource Management**: Improve browser resource management with:
   - Page pooling for better performance
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Memory usage monitoring

5. **Enhance Docker Setup**: Further improve the Docker configuration to support development, testing, and production environments.

6. **Create CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the MCP Browser.

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design**: The RESTful API approach with WebSocket support is working well. Continuing with this pattern for remaining endpoints.

2. **Page Lifecycle Management**: Currently creating and destroying pages for each request. Considering implementing a page pool for better performance, especially under high load.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've established a consistent pattern using try-except blocks with structured error responses. Need to formalize this into a reusable utility.

4. **Testing Approach**: The current test script works well for basic API validation. Need to decide on a more comprehensive testing framework (pytest, etc.) for more complex tests.

5. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

7. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

8. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

9. **Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method**: Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method
10. **Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling**: Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling
11. **Focusing on core browser analysis functionality before implementing MCP protocol extensions**: Focusing on core browser analysis functionality before implementing MCP protocol extensions

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper resource management for browser instances to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

3. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.

## Current Sprint Goals

1. Complete the core API implementation for frontend analysis (screenshot, DOM, CSS, accessibility, responsive)
2. Implement basic MCP protocol extensions
3. Set up comprehensive testing framework with good test coverage
4. Enhance documentation with API usage examples
5. Implement proper error handling and resource management
