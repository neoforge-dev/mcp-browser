# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

We have successfully installed and configured MCP Browser with the browser visualization system, after addressing issues with the XQuartz display server. 

Our current focus is on:

1. **Installation Script Cleanup**: We have multiple redundant installation scripts that need consolidation.
2. **Resource Management Improvements**: Implement browser resource pooling and memory optimization.
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Further improve API documentation with examples.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthen security with network isolation and rate limiting.

## Latest Changes

- Fixed issues with XQuartz integration in the installation scripts
- Created a more robust approach to launching X11 server during installation
- Successfully deployed and tested the MCP Browser
- Added WebSocket event subscription models and event type definitions
- Implemented global event subscription management and broadcasting
- Created a WebSocket endpoint for browser events at `/ws/browser/events`
- Added API endpoints for subscription management (subscribe, unsubscribe, list)
- Added event filtering functionality by URL pattern and page ID
- Fixed WebSocket event subscription to handle missing dependencies gracefully

## Development Summary (March 24, 2025)

Today we accomplished:

1. **Installation Script Debugging**:
   - Identified and fixed issues with XQuartz display server startup
   - Created a simplified installation script that works with pre-started X11
   - Successfully completed installation on Mac Mini
   - Documented the installation process and fixes

2. **Script Cleanup Required**:
   - We need to consolidate multiple redundant installation scripts
   - Current redundant scripts include:
     - `install_one_line.sh`: One-line installation launcher
     - `install_mcp_browser.sh`: Main installer script
     - `install_helper.sh`: Helper to fix line endings and XQuartz issues
     - `simple_install.sh`: Simplified installer that skips XQuartz setup
   - We should keep only the essential scripts and update documentation

## Active Decisions

1. **Installation Script Cleanup**: We'll consolidate the installation scripts into:
   - One main installer script with robust error handling
   - A one-line launcher that properly handles all edge cases
   - Update documentation to reflect these changes

2. **XQuartz Integration Strategy**: Rather than trying different approaches to launch XQuartz, we'll:
   - Check if XQuartz/X11 is already running first
   - Try direct binary execution if not running
   - Fall back to app launching only as a last resort
   - Add clear error messages and documentation for troubleshooting

3. **API Design**: The RESTful API approach with WebSocket support is working well. Continuing with this pattern for remaining endpoints.

4. **Page Lifecycle Management**: Currently creating and destroying pages for each request. Considering implementing a page pool for better performance, especially under high load.

5. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've established a consistent pattern using try-except blocks with structured error responses. Need to formalize this into a reusable utility.

6. **Testing Approach**: The current test script works well for basic API validation. Need to decide on a more comprehensive testing framework (pytest, etc.) for more complex tests.

7. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

8. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

9. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

10. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

11. **Browser Context Management**: Implementing browser context management so pages can be properly accessed and handled without synchronization issues.

12. **Using separate WebSocket endpoints for different features**:
    - `/ws` for general communication
    - `/ws/browser/events` for event subscriptions
    
13. **Event subscriptions are managed per client connection with unique IDs**:
    - We've implemented a broadcasting mechanism that filters events based on subscription criteria
    
14. **Using JSON for all WebSocket communication for consistency and ease of debugging**

15. **Using graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies**: Implemented try-except patterns for optional dependencies like colorama to ensure core functionality works regardless of environment setup.

16. **Aligning WebSocket URLs and port configurations**: Standardized WebSocket endpoint paths and port configurations across Docker, test scripts, and server code to ensure seamless communication.

## Open Questions

1. **Should we implement a separate authentication mechanism for WebSocket connections?**
   
2. **How should we handle reconnection logic for clients that disconnect temporarily?**
   
3. **What's the optimal approach for scaling the event broadcasting system for many simultaneous connections?**
   
4. **Should we implement event batching for high-frequency events to avoid overwhelming clients?**

## Current Blockers

1. **Script Proliferation**: Too many redundant scripts causing confusion and maintenance issues.

2. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper resource management for browser instances to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

4. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.
