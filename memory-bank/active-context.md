## Current Blocker: `page.goto()` Timeout
- **Status**: `test_allowed_domain_access` timeout blocks Phase 2
- **Ruled Out**: Network isolation, Playwright version, Xvfb, D-Bus
- **Next**: Fix build/runtime errors, then re-test
- **Hypothesis**: Docker Desktop Mac virtualization issue

## Phase 2 Goals (Blocked)
1. **BLOCKER**: Resolve `page.goto()` timeout
2. Resource pool cleanup
3. Test coverage
4. API rate limiting
5. Static analysis
6. System monitoring

## Blocked Tasks
- Network routing tests
- Rate limiting testing
- Resource optimization
- Security hardening
- Monitoring integration

## Recent Changes
- Fixed Docker build errors
- Simplified networking
- Increased timeout to 300s
- Tried Playwright v1.50.0
- Refactored test fixtures/cleanup

## Key Decisions
- Using `pip install .` in Dockerfile
- Default bridge network
- Playwright v1.50.0-noble base

## Open Questions
- Root cause of timeout?
- Event broadcast optimization?
- Rate limit configuration?
- Static analysis tool?
- Monitoring metrics?

## Focus Areas
1. Resource management
2. Test coverage
3. Security
4. Verification
5. Monitoring
6. DevEx

## Current Sprint
1. Evaluate test isolation needs
2. Add network routing tests
3. Add error handling tests
4. Refine resource monitoring
5. Update documentation
