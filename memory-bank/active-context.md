# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

The project is at version 0.4.0 with core features implemented. Our current focus is on:

1. **Resource Management**: Implementing browser context management and resource pooling for better performance and stability.
2. **Security Enhancements**: Implementing rate limiting, granular AppArmor profiles, and network isolation.
3. **Verification Agent**: Integrating static analysis tools, unit test automation, and security checks.
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Setting up NetData, Loki+Grafana, and cAdvisor for comprehensive monitoring.
5. **Developer Experience**: Creating comprehensive API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

## Latest Changes

- Successfully implemented all core frontend analysis APIs
- Completed MCP protocol extensions implementation
- Implemented WebSocket event subscriptions with filtering
- Fixed XQuartz integration issues
- Added basic security measures with AppArmor profiles
- Established core documentation structure

## Development Summary (April 7, 2024)

Current technical debt and must-have tasks identified:

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Implement browser context management for multi-session support
   - Add robust resource cleanup after API calls
   - Optimize performance for high-volume event broadcasting

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Create more granular AppArmor profiles
   - Improve network isolation

3. **Verification Agent Features**:
   - Integrate static analysis tools
   - Implement unit test automation
   - Add security checks

4. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Integrate NetData for system metrics
   - Set up Loki+Grafana for logging
   - Add cAdvisor for container monitoring

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - Develop CLI tool for easier interaction
   - Add more example scripts and tutorials

## Active Decisions

1. **Resource Management Strategy**:
   - Implement browser context management for proper page handling
   - Add resource pooling to prevent memory leaks
   - Optimize event broadcasting for high load

2. **Security Implementation**:
   - Implement rate limiting using FastAPI middleware
   - Create granular AppArmor profiles for different operations
   - Use Docker network isolation features

3. **Verification Agent Architecture**:
   - Use existing static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube)
   - Implement pytest for unit test automation
   - Add security scanning tools

4. **Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Use NetData for real-time system metrics
   - Implement Loki+Grafana for log aggregation
   - Use cAdvisor for container metrics

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Use FastAPI's built-in documentation features
   - Create CLI tool using Click or Typer
   - Provide comprehensive examples

## Open Questions

1. **What's the optimal approach for browser context management?**
   - Should we use a pool of browser contexts?
   - How to handle context cleanup?

2. **How to implement efficient rate limiting?**
   - What should be the rate limits?
   - How to handle burst traffic?

3. **What static analysis tools to integrate?**
   - Which tools provide the most value?
   - How to handle false positives?

4. **How to structure the monitoring setup?**
   - What metrics are most important?
   - How to handle alerting?

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper browser context management to prevent memory leaks and improve performance.

2. **Security Implementation**: Need to implement rate limiting and improve network isolation.

3. **Verification Tools**: Need to select and integrate appropriate static analysis and security tools.

4. **Monitoring Setup**: Need to configure and integrate monitoring tools.
