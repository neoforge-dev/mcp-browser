# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

We are currently implementing the core API functionality for the MCP Browser project. The focus is on:

1. **API Development**: Implementing the core API endpoints for frontend analysis capabilities, including screenshot capture, DOM extraction, and CSS analysis.

2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Establishing and enhancing the testing framework to validate API functionality.

3. **MCP Protocol Extensions**: Beginning implementation of MCP protocol extensions for browser interaction.

## Recent Changes

1. **Implemented CSS Analysis API**: Added a new API endpoint `/api/css/analyze` that provides CSS property analysis for selected elements:
   - Detailed style property extraction
   - Optional accessibility checking
   - Element visibility and positioning information
   - Customizable property selection

2. **Created Testing Framework**: Developed a testing framework with:
   - Automated test script for all API endpoints
   - Test shell script for easy execution
   - Result validation and reporting
   - Test artifact storage (screenshots, DOM data, CSS data)

3. **Implemented Screenshot Capture API**: Added a new API endpoint `/api/screenshots/capture` that allows capturing screenshots of web pages with configurable options:
   - Customizable viewport size
   - Full page or viewport-only screenshots
   - Image format (PNG/JPEG) and quality options
   - Navigation timing control

4. **Fixed DOM Extraction API**: Fixed the DOM extraction API by correctly implementing the Playwright page.evaluate() method
5. **Added appropriate JS function structure with arrow functions**: Added appropriate JS function structure with arrow functions
6. **Implemented proper passing of parameters to the JS functions**: Implemented proper passing of parameters to the JS functions
7. **Successfully verified all API endpoints are working with the test script**: Successfully verified all API endpoints are working with the test script

8. **Created Feature Implementation Plan**: Developed a detailed implementation plan for the MCP Browser features in `mcp-browser-features.md` that includes:
   - API designs for frontend analysis capabilities
   - MCP protocol extension specifications
   - Verification agent integration plans
   - Monitoring and metrics implementation details
   - Developer experience enhancements
   - Security improvement strategies

9. **Updated Docker Configuration**: Modified the Docker Compose file to reference environment variables for better configurability and security.

10. **Created Environment Configuration**: Added `.env.example` file to guide users on setting up the required environment variables.

11. **Enhanced Build Scripts**: Improved the run script to handle environment files and provide better error messages.

12. **Established Memory Bank**: Created core documentation files to maintain project knowledge and track progress.

- Organized output files from API endpoints into dedicated folders:
  - Created `/output/screenshots` for screenshot capture outputs
  - Created `/output/dom` for DOM extraction data 
  - Created `/output/css` for CSS analysis results
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude output directories from version control
- Modified test scripts to use the new output directories
- Fixed the DOM extraction and CSS analysis endpoints by correctly implementing the Playwright page.evaluate() method
- Added appropriate JS function structure with arrow functions
- Implemented proper passing of parameters to the JS functions using f-strings
- Successfully verified all API endpoints are working with the test script

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Frontend Analysis APIs**: Implement the remaining frontend analysis endpoints:
   - Accessibility Testing API
   - Responsive Design Testing API

2. **Implement MCP Protocol Extensions**: Begin implementation of the MCP protocol extensions for browser interaction, starting with:
   - Browser navigation tools
   - DOM manipulation tools
   - Visual analysis tools

3. **Enhance Testing Framework**: Expand the testing framework with:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests with real browser instances
   - Performance and security tests

4. **Implement Resource Management**: Improve browser resource management with:
   - Page pooling for better performance
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Memory usage monitoring

5. **Enhance Docker Setup**: Further improve the Docker configuration to support development, testing, and production environments.

6. **Create CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the MCP Browser.

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design**: The RESTful API approach with WebSocket support is working well. Continuing with this pattern for remaining endpoints.

2. **Page Lifecycle Management**: Currently creating and destroying pages for each request. Considering implementing a page pool for better performance, especially under high load.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've established a consistent pattern using try-except blocks with structured error responses. Need to formalize this into a reusable utility.

4. **Testing Approach**: The current test script works well for basic API validation. Need to decide on a more comprehensive testing framework (pytest, etc.) for more complex tests.

5. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

7. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

8. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

9. **Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method**: Decided to use f-strings to inject parameters directly into JavaScript functions to avoid complications with parameter passing in Playwright's evaluate method
10. **Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling**: Using a minimalistic approach for API endpoint validation and error handling
11. **Focusing on core browser analysis functionality before implementing MCP protocol extensions**: Focusing on core browser analysis functionality before implementing MCP protocol extensions

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Management**: Need to implement proper resource management for browser instances to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

3. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.

## Current Sprint Goals

1. Complete the core API implementation for frontend analysis (screenshot, DOM, CSS, accessibility, responsive)
2. Implement basic MCP protocol extensions
3. Set up comprehensive testing framework with good test coverage
4. Enhance documentation with API usage examples
5. Implement proper error handling and resource management
