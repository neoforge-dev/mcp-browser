# Active Context - MCP Browser Project

## Current Focus

We are currently in the planning and documentation phase for the MCP Browser project. The focus is on:

1. **Feature Planning**: Developing detailed implementation plans for the features identified in the project requirements, with particular attention to API design, implementation tasks, and technical details.

2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Creating comprehensive documentation to support development, testing, and deployment of the MCP Browser.

3. **Infrastructure Setup**: Establishing the necessary infrastructure for development, testing, and deployment, including Docker configurations, environment variables, and build scripts.

## Recent Changes

1. **Created Feature Implementation Plan**: Developed a detailed implementation plan for the MCP Browser features in `mcp-browser-features.md` that includes:
   - API designs for frontend analysis capabilities
   - MCP protocol extension specifications
   - Verification agent integration plans
   - Monitoring and metrics implementation details
   - Developer experience enhancements
   - Security improvement strategies

2. **Updated Docker Configuration**: Modified the Docker Compose file to reference environment variables for better configurability and security.

3. **Created Environment Configuration**: Added `.env.example` file to guide users on setting up the required environment variables.

4. **Enhanced Build Scripts**: Improved the run script to handle environment files and provide better error messages.

5. **Established Memory Bank**: Created core documentation files to maintain project knowledge and track progress.

## Next Steps

1. **Develop API Prototype**: Implement a minimal viable prototype of the MCP Browser API with basic functionality for browser control and screenshot capture.

2. **Set Up Testing Framework**: Establish a testing framework for the MCP Browser, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

3. **Implement Core MCP Tools**: Begin implementation of the MCP protocol extensions for browser interaction, starting with basic navigation and DOM analysis.

4. **Enhance Docker Setup**: Further improve the Docker configuration to support development, testing, and production environments.

5. **Create CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the MCP Browser.

## Active Decisions/Considerations

1. **API Design**: Considering the best approach for API design to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and performance. Current preference is for a RESTful API with WebSocket support for real-time events.

2. **Security Model**: Evaluating security requirements and implementation strategies, including AppArmor profiles, network isolation, and rate limiting.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Considering strategies for optimizing browser performance, particularly in container environments with resource constraints.

4. **Monitoring Strategy**: Evaluating monitoring tools and approaches, with a focus on real-time metrics, log aggregation, and alerting.

5. **Developer Experience**: Considering approaches to enhance developer experience, including API documentation, CLI tools, and example scripts.

## Current Blockers

1. **Resource Constraints**: Need to determine optimal resource allocation for containers, particularly for browser instances.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility with different browser versions and configurations.

3. **Testing Environment**: Need to establish a suitable testing environment for browser automation and visual testing.

## Current Sprint Goals

1. Complete the detailed feature implementation plan
2. Set up the initial development environment
3. Implement a minimal API prototype
4. Establish basic testing framework
5. Begin implementation of core MCP tools
