# Progress - MCP Browser Project

## What Works

- **Screenshot Capture API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/screenshots/capture` endpoint that captures screenshots of web pages with configurable options for viewport size, image format, and quality.

- **DOM Extraction API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/dom/extract` endpoint that provides detailed DOM structure analysis with support for CSS selector targeting, style computation, and attribute extraction.

- **CSS Analysis API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/css/analyze` endpoint that extracts and analyzes CSS properties of selected elements with optional accessibility checks.

- **Accessibility Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/accessibility/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages for accessibility issues following various standards like WCAG and Section 508.

- **Responsive Design Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/responsive/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages across different viewport sizes to identify responsive design issues and compare element behavior.

- **MCP Protocol Extensions**: Successfully implemented the API endpoints for browser interaction including browser navigation (navigate, back, forward, refresh), DOM manipulation (click, type, select, check visibility, wait for selectors), and visual analysis (screenshot, extract text, evaluate JavaScript).

- **Testing Framework**: Created a basic testing framework with script to verify API functionality.

- **Docker Containerization**: The project successfully runs in a Docker container with appropriate security profiles.

- **Xvfb Integration**: Virtual X server is configured and functioning correctly for headless browser operation.

- **Playwright Integration**: Playwright browser automation is correctly set up and can control browser instances.

- **FastAPI Server**: Basic server is operational with API endpoints and WebSocket support.

- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variable handling is implemented with .env file support.

- **Build Scripts**: Basic build and run scripts are operational.

- **Security Profiles**: Initial AppArmor profiles are in place for container security.

- **Documentation**: Core documentation structure is established with Memory Bank approach.

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.4.0

The MCP Browser now supports all core protocol extensions, WebSocket event subscriptions, and has been successfully installed on a Mac Mini. The event subscription system allows clients to subscribe to various browser events (PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK) and receive real-time notifications when these events occur.

Key components implemented:
- HTTP API for browser control and interaction
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time browser events 
- Event subscription management endpoints
- Event filtering by URL pattern and page ID
- Comprehensive documentation of the WebSocket events feature
- Robust installation with XQuartz display server integration

## Installation Status

We have successfully addressed installation issues with XQuartz (X11) display server:
- Identified issues with XQuartz app launching on Mac Mini
- Created more robust approach to starting X11 server
- Implemented direct binary execution as a fallback
- Successfully completed installation and testing

However, we now have several redundant installation scripts that need to be consolidated:
- `install_one_line.sh`: One-line installation launcher
- `install_mcp_browser.sh`: Main installer script
- `install_helper.sh`: Helper script to fix line endings and XQuartz issues
- `simple_install.sh`: Simplified installer that skips XQuartz setup

Our cleanup plan includes:
1. Consolidate into one robust main installer script
2. Update the one-line launcher with better error handling
3. Remove redundant scripts
4. Update documentation to reflect changes

## What's Left to Build

- Script cleanup and consolidation
- Browser context management (multiple browser instances)
- Additional DOM manipulation commands
- Network interception and modification
- Cookie and storage management
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration with external tools and services

## Known Issues

- Multiple redundant installation scripts causing confusion
- WebSocket connection might drop if the browser is heavily loaded
- Some edge cases in event filtering need to be handled
- Better error reporting for failed subscriptions
- Performance optimization for high-volume event broadcasting

## Next Development Priorities

1. Clean up and consolidate installation scripts
2. Add browser context management for multi-session support
3. Implement additional DOM manipulation commands
4. Add network interception capabilities
5. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
6. Create a client library in Python for easier integration

## Progress Status

- [x] Project structure set up
- [x] Basic server functionality with FastAPI
- [x] Playwright integration for browser control
- [x] WebSocket interface for real-time communication
- [x] Screenshot capture API endpoint
- [x] DOM extraction API endpoint

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing and testing the core browser analysis APIs:

1. Screenshot capture - ✅ COMPLETED
2. DOM extraction - ✅ COMPLETED
3. CSS analysis - ✅ COMPLETED
4. Accessibility testing - ✅ COMPLETED
5. Responsive design testing - ✅ COMPLETED
6. MCP protocol extensions - ✅ COMPLETED

Now shifting focus to:
1. ~~WebSocket event subscriptions~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. Resource management improvements
3. Enhanced security features

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Browser Resource Management | Need proper cleanup of browser resources after API calls | Medium | In Progress |
| Error Handling Consistency | Need standardized error handling across all API endpoints | Medium | To Address |
| MCPClient Implementation | The current MCPClient implementation needs refinement for stability | Medium | To Address |
| Xvfb on macOS | Xvfb configuration causes issues on macOS development environments | Low | Investigating |
| WebSocket Connections | Unexpected termination of WebSocket connections under high load | Medium | To Address |
| Resource Constraints | Current container resource limits may not be optimal | Medium | Need Testing |
- ~~DOM extraction endpoint failing with Playwright API errors~~ - FIXED
- ~~CSS analysis endpoint failing with Playwright API errors~~ - FIXED
- ~~Output files organization~~ - FIXED: All output files now stored in dedicated folders under `/output`
- Docker image build failing due to issues with Playwright base image
