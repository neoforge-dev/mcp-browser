# Progress - MCP Browser (v0.4.0)

## Completed Features

*   **Core APIs**: Screenshot, DOM Extract, CSS Analyze, Accessibility Test, Responsive Test.
*   **MCP Extensions**: Browser Navigation, DOM Manipulation, Visual Analysis tools integrated.
*   **WebSocket Events**: Real-time PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK events with filtering.
*   **Basic Security**: AppArmor, Non-root execution, Basic API auth.
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Xvfb, Playwright, FastAPI, Basic scripts.
*   **Test Suite Stabilization**: Resolved test hangs, refactored fixtures, improved cleanup robustness (Phase 1).

## Pending Tasks (Prioritized)

### High Priority (Must Have)

1.  **Resource Mgmt**: Browser context/pool mgmt robustness, Perf optimization (high-volume events).
2.  **Security**: Rate limiting, Granular AppArmor, Network isolation improvements.
3.  **Verification Agent**: Static analysis integration, Test automation coverage, Security checks.
4.  **Monitoring**: NetData, Loki+Grafana, cAdvisor integration.
5.  **DevEx**: API docs (w/ examples), CLI tool, Example scripts.

### Medium Priority

1.  **Network Features**: Interception/modification, Cookie/storage mgmt, Perf metrics.
2.  **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage (Integration, Performance).
3.  **Error Handling**: Standardized responses, Better reporting, Graceful degradation.

## Current Status Summary

Core features implemented. Phase 1 test stabilization complete. Focus shifts to Phase 2: Enhancing robustness and adding features.

## Known Issues
- **(Resolved)** Test Suite Hang: Test suite previously hung during teardown.
- **(Resolved)** Inconsistent Fixture Usage: Tests were not consistently using shared fixtures.
- **(Resolved)** Potential Cleanup Fragility: Cleanup logic improved.

## Next Steps
- Execute Phase 2: Enhance Robustness (Evaluate test isolation, add test coverage).
- Begin implementing high-priority features: Security, Verification, Monitoring, DevEx.
- Update `system-patterns.md` with lessons learned from stabilization.
