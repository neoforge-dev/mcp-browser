# Progress - MCP Browser (Optimized)

## Current Status
*   Phase 1 (Test Stabilization) Complete.
*   Phase 2 (Robustness Enhancement) **Blocked** by `page.goto()` timeout in Docker tests.
*   Multiple build/runtime errors resolved recently.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  Run `make test` to confirm latest fixes allow container to start.
2.  If container starts, verify if `page.goto()` timeout is resolved.
3.  If timeout persists, investigate next hypothesis (Docker Desktop/Mac interaction).
4.  If timeout resolved, unblock Phase 2 tasks (testing rate limits, network routing, etc.).

## Completed (High Level)
*   Core Service & APIs (FastAPI, Playwright integration).
*   MCP Command Handling & WebSocket Events.
*   Basic Security (AppArmor, Non-root).
*   Docker Infrastructure.
*   Test Suite Foundational Stabilization.
*   Build/Dependency Management Refinement.

## Pending / Blocked (Phase 2+)
*   **Phase 2 (Blocked)**:
    *   Resolve `page.goto()` Timeout **(BLOCKER)**
    *   Test Network Routing Rules
    *   Test Error Handling
    *   Test Resource Monitoring
    *   Test Rate Limiting
*   Resource Management Perf Tuning.
*   Security Hardening (Granular AppArmor, Auth?).
*   Verification Agent Integration (Static Analysis).
*   Monitoring Integration (NetData, Loki, etc.).
*   Developer Experience (API Docs, CLI).

## Key Blocker History
*   Initial test hangs (Resolved - Fixture/Cleanup refactor).
*   Dependency management issues (Resolved - `Dockerfile` fixes).
*   Runtime import errors (Resolved - `main.py`, `rate_limiter.py` fixes).
*   `page.goto()` timeout (Current Blocker).

## Completed Features
*   Core APIs (Screenshot, DOM, CSS, Access., Responsive)
*   MCP Extensions (Nav, DOM Manip, Visual Analysis)
*   WebSocket Events (Real-time PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK w/ filter)
*   Basic Security (AppArmor, Non-root)
*   Infrastructure (Docker, Xvfb, Playwright, FastAPI)
*   Test Suite Stabilization (Phase 1: Hangs resolved, fixtures refactored, cleanup improved)

## Pending Tasks (High Priority)
1.  **Resource Mgmt**: Pool/Context cleanup robustness, Event perf optimization.
2.  **Security**: Rate limiting, Granular AppArmor, Network isolation hardening.
3.  **Verification**: Static analysis, Test coverage, Security checks.
4.  **Monitoring**: NetData, Loki+Grafana, cAdvisor integration.
5.  **DevEx**: API docs, CLI tool, Examples.

## Target Milestones (Adjusted)
*   **TBD**: Complete resource mgmt robustness (Blocked by test timeout).
*   **TBD**: Implement security enhancements.
*   **TBD**: Integrate verification tools.
*   **TBD**: Set up monitoring infrastructure.
*   **TBD**: Enhance developer experience.
