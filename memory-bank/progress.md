# Progress - MCP Browser Project

## What Works

- **Docker Containerization**: The project successfully runs in a Docker container with appropriate security profiles.
- **Xvfb Integration**: Virtual X server is configured and functioning correctly for headless browser operation.
- **Playwright Integration**: Playwright browser automation is correctly set up and can control browser instances.
- **FastAPI Server**: Basic server is operational with API endpoints and WebSocket support.
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variable handling is implemented with .env file support.
- **Build Scripts**: Basic build and run scripts are operational.
- **Security Profiles**: Initial AppArmor profiles are in place for container security.
- **Documentation**: Core documentation structure is established with Memory Bank approach.

## What's Left to Build

- **Frontend Analysis Features**:
  - Screenshot capture and comparison functionality
  - DOM state analysis tools
  - CSS analysis capabilities
  - Accessibility testing features
  - Responsive design testing tools

- **MCP Protocol Extensions**:
  - Browser-specific MCP tools
  - DOM manipulation tools  
  - Visual analysis tools
  - WebSocket event subscriptions

- **Verification Agent**:
  - Static analysis integration
  - Unit test automation
  - Security checks implementation

- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - NetData integration
  - Loki + Grafana setup
  - cAdvisor integration

- **Developer Experience**:
  - API documentation
  - CLI tool
  - Example scripts

- **Enhanced Security**:
  - Rate limiting
  - Granular AppArmor profiles
  - Network isolation

## Current Status

The project is in the planning and early implementation stage. We have:

1. Established the core infrastructure (Docker, Xvfb, Playwright, FastAPI)
2. Created comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank
3. Developed detailed feature implementation plans with API designs and implementation tasks
4. Set up the basic development environment with Docker and required configurations

Current focus is on planning the implementation of frontend analysis capabilities and MCP protocol extensions, which will form the foundation for the browser intelligence features.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| MCPClient Implementation | The current MCPClient implementation needs refinement for stability | Medium | To Address |
| Xvfb on macOS | Xvfb configuration causes issues on macOS development environments | Low | Investigating |
| WebSocket Connections | Unexpected termination of WebSocket connections under high load | Medium | To Address |
| Resource Constraints | Current container resource limits may not be optimal | Medium | Need Testing |

## Next Major Milestones
