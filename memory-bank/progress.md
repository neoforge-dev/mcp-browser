# Progress - MCP Browser Project

## What Works

- **Screenshot Capture API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/screenshots/capture` endpoint that captures screenshots of web pages with configurable options for viewport size, image format, and quality.

- **DOM Extraction API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/dom/extract` endpoint that provides detailed DOM structure analysis with support for CSS selector targeting, style computation, and attribute extraction.

- **CSS Analysis API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/css/analyze` endpoint that extracts and analyzes CSS properties of selected elements with optional accessibility checks.

- **Accessibility Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/accessibility/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages for accessibility issues following various standards like WCAG and Section 508.

- **Responsive Design Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/responsive/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages across different viewport sizes to identify responsive design issues and compare element behavior.

- **Testing Framework**: Created a basic testing framework with script to verify API functionality.

- **Docker Containerization**: The project successfully runs in a Docker container with appropriate security profiles.

- **Xvfb Integration**: Virtual X server is configured and functioning correctly for headless browser operation.

- **Playwright Integration**: Playwright browser automation is correctly set up and can control browser instances.

- **FastAPI Server**: Basic server is operational with API endpoints and WebSocket support.

- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variable handling is implemented with .env file support.

- **Build Scripts**: Basic build and run scripts are operational.

- **Security Profiles**: Initial AppArmor profiles are in place for container security.

- **Documentation**: Core documentation structure is established with Memory Bank approach.
