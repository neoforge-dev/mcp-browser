# Progress - MCP Browser Project

## What Works

- **Core Frontend Analysis APIs**:
  - Screenshot Capture API (`/api/screenshots/capture`)
  - DOM Extraction API (`/api/dom/extract`)
  - CSS Analysis API (`/api/css/analyze`)
  - Accessibility Testing API (`/api/accessibility/test`)
  - Responsive Design Testing API (`/api/responsive/test`)

- **MCP Protocol Extensions**:
  - Browser Navigation Tools (navigate, back, forward, refresh, get URL, get title)
  - DOM Manipulation Tools (click, type, select, fill form, check visibility, wait for selector, evaluate Javascript)
  - Visual Analysis Tools (screenshot, extract text, evaluate Javascript)

- **WebSocket Event Subscriptions**:
  - Real-time event streaming for PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, and NETWORK events
  - Subscription management (subscribe, unsubscribe, list)
  - Event filtering by URL pattern and page ID

- **Basic Security**:
  - AppArmor profiles for Docker containers
  - Non-root container execution
  - Basic API authentication

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Docker containerization
  - Xvfb virtual display
  - Playwright automation engine
  - FastAPI server
  - Environment configuration
  - Basic build and run scripts

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority (Must Have)

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Browser context management for multi-session support
   - Resource cleanup after API calls
   - Performance optimization for high-volume events

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Granular AppArmor profiles
   - Network isolation improvements

3. **Verification Agent**:
   - Static analysis integration
   - Unit test automation
   - Security checks implementation

4. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - NetData integration
   - Loki + Grafana setup
   - cAdvisor integration

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - CLI tool for easier interaction
   - Example scripts and tutorials

### Medium Priority

1. **Network Features**:
   - Network interception and modification
   - Cookie and storage management
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Standardized error responses
   - Better error reporting
   - Graceful degradation

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.4.0

The MCP Browser has successfully implemented all core features including frontend analysis APIs, MCP protocol extensions, and WebSocket event subscriptions. The project is now focusing on resource management, security enhancements, and developer experience improvements.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Browser Resource Management | Need proper cleanup of browser resources after API calls | High | In Progress |
| Rate Limiting | Missing rate limiting for API endpoints | High | To Address |
| Network Isolation | Need improved network isolation in Docker | High | To Address |
| Static Analysis | Missing integration with static analysis tools | High | To Address |
| Monitoring | No comprehensive monitoring setup | High | To Address |
| Documentation | API documentation needs examples | Medium | To Address |
| Error Handling | Need standardized error handling | Medium | To Address |
