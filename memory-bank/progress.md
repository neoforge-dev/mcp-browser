# Progress - MCP Browser (v0.4.0)

## Completed Features

*   **Core APIs**: Screenshot, DOM Extract, CSS Analyze, Accessibility Test, Responsive Test.
*   **MCP Extensions**: Browser Navigation, DOM Manipulation, Visual Analysis tools integrated.
*   **WebSocket Events**: Real-time PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK events with filtering.
*   **Basic Security**: AppArmor, Non-root execution, Basic API auth.
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Xvfb, Playwright, FastAPI, Basic scripts.

## Pending Tasks (Prioritized)

### High Priority (Must Have)

1.  **Resource Mgmt**: Browser context/pool mgmt, Resource cleanup, Perf optimization (high-volume events).
2.  **Security**: Rate limiting, Granular AppArmor, Network isolation improvements.
3.  **Verification Agent**: Static analysis integration, Test automation, Security checks.
4.  **Monitoring**: NetData, Loki+Grafana, cAdvisor integration.
5.  **DevEx**: API docs (w/ examples), CLI tool, Example scripts.

### Medium Priority

1.  **Network Features**: Interception/modification, Cookie/storage mgmt, Perf metrics.
2.  **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage (Integration, Performance).
3.  **Error Handling**: Standardized responses, Better reporting, Graceful degradation.

## Current Status Summary

Core features implemented. Focus now on resource management, security, verification, monitoring, and DevEx.

## Known Issues
- **Test Suite Hang:** The `pytest` suite currently hangs during session teardown (fixture cleanup) after `test_browser_pool_limits` fails. This prevents test completion and requires manual interruption. (See `active-context.md` for resolution plan).
- **Inconsistent Fixture Usage:** `test_browser_pool_limits` creates its own `BrowserPool` instead of using the shared session fixture, leading to inconsistent testing. (Part of the hang resolution plan).
- **Potential Cleanup Fragility:** The robustness of browser/context cleanup in error scenarios needs improvement. (Part of the hang resolution plan).

## Next Steps
- Execute Phase 1 of the test stabilization plan outlined in `active-context.md`.
- Refactor `test_browser_pool_limits`.
- Improve cleanup robustness in `BrowserPool` / `BrowserInstance`.
- Refine logging and remove debug timeouts.
- Verify test suite completion.
