# Progress - MCP Browser (Optimized)

## Completed Features
*   Core APIs (Screenshot, DOM, CSS, Access., Responsive)
*   MCP Extensions (Nav, DOM Manip, Visual Analysis)
*   WebSocket Events (Real-time PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK w/ filter)
*   Basic Security (AppArmor, Non-root)
*   Infrastructure (Docker, Xvfb, Playwright, FastAPI)
*   Test Suite Stabilization (Phase 1: Hangs resolved, fixtures refactored, cleanup improved)

## Pending Tasks (High Priority)
1.  **Resource Mgmt**: Pool/Context cleanup robustness, Event perf optimization.
2.  **Security**: Rate limiting, Granular AppArmor, Network isolation hardening.
3.  **Verification**: Static analysis, Test coverage, Security checks.
4.  **Monitoring**: NetData, Loki+Grafana, cAdvisor integration.
5.  **DevEx**: API docs, CLI tool, Examples.

## Current Status Summary
*   Phase 1 (Test Stabilization) Complete.
*   Phase 2 (Robustness Enhancement) In Progress.
*   **Blocker**: Investigating `page.goto()` timeout in network tests (see `active-context.md`).

## Next Steps
*   Resolve `page.goto()` timeout blocker.
*   Continue Phase 2: Add test coverage (error handling, resource monitoring details).
*   Begin implementing high-priority features (Security, Verification, Monitoring, DevEx).
