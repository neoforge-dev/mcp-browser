- **CSS Analysis API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/css/analyze` endpoint that extracts and analyzes CSS properties of selected elements with optional accessibility checks.

- **Accessibility Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/accessibility/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages for accessibility issues following various standards like WCAG and Section 508.

- **Responsive Design Testing API**: Successfully implemented the `/api/responsive/test` endpoint that analyzes web pages across different viewport sizes to identify responsive design issues and compare element behavior.

- **MCP Protocol Extensions**: Successfully implemented the API endpoints for browser interaction including browser navigation (navigate, back, forward, refresh), DOM manipulation (click, type, select, check visibility, wait for selectors), and visual analysis (screenshot, extract text, evaluate JavaScript).

- **Testing Framework**: Created a basic testing framework with script to verify API functionality.

- **Docker Containerization**: The project successfully runs in a Docker container with appropriate security profiles.

- **Xvfb Integration**: Virtual X server is configured and functioning correctly for headless browser operation.

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.4.0

The MCP Browser now supports all core protocol extensions and WebSocket event subscriptions. The event subscription system allows clients to subscribe to various browser events (PAGE, DOM, CONSOLE, NETWORK) and receive real-time notifications when these events occur.

Key components implemented:
- HTTP API for browser control and interaction
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time browser events 
- Event subscription management endpoints
- Event filtering by URL pattern and page ID
- Comprehensive documentation of the WebSocket events feature

## What's Left to Build

- Browser context management (multiple browser instances)
- Additional DOM manipulation commands
- Network interception and modification
- Cookie and storage management
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration with external tools and services

## Known Issues

- WebSocket connection might drop if the browser is heavily loaded
- Some edge cases in event filtering need to be handled
- Better error reporting for failed subscriptions
- Performance optimization for high-volume event broadcasting

## Next Development Priorities

1. Add browser context management for multi-session support
2. Implement additional DOM manipulation commands
3. Add network interception capabilities
4. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
5. Create a client library in Python for easier integration
